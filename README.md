# Automate Machine Learning with Autogluon
#### AutoGluon is one of the SOTA open-source AutoML libraries developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to train high-quality machine learning models with just a few lines of code. AutoGluon automates:

#### Model selection: Tests algorithms to find the best fit.
#### Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizes model settings for performance.
#### Feature preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical data, and scaling.
#### Ensembling: Combines models to boost accuracy.

#### It supports tabular data, text, images, and more. For this tutorial, weâ€™ll focus on tabular data (e.g., spreadsheets)
